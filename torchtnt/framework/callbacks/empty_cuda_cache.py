    """
    A callback that performs periodic emptying of cuda cache using `torch.cuda.empty_cache <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.cuda.empty_cache.html#torch.cuda.empty_cache>_.

    On different ranks, reserved memory and fragmentation might diverge after several iterations.
    If different ranks trigger de-fragmentation (i.e. cudaFree and redo cudaMalloc later)
    at different times, there will be different stragglers in different iterations, which will
    hurt the performance and will get worse with larger clusters. To avoid this, this callback
    calls empty_cache() at the same cadence across all ranks.

    Args:
        step_interval: number of steps to run before emptying cuda cache
